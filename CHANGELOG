[0.75.0-dev-pre](2020.02.10)(compatible)

--Additions--
1) New cache_retval decorator that caches functions
using django's low-level caching api. (used for context
processors)
2) New property of Topic, valid. Returns true for existing
objects and False for pseudo topics that are not valid with
given title.
3) List of contributors

internally), are now cached.

database queries. (entry_list.html, inbox.html)

from 1.1.9 to 1.2.0

in a more correct way.

[0.73.0-dev-pre](2020.02.04)(compatible)

--Additions--
1) This project now uses 2 more external libraries,
"js-cookies" in javascript and "user_agents" in Python.
2) New middleware: MobileDetectionMiddleware, detects if
the user is mobile or not and adds the bool value to the request.
(This is/will used to not render some parts of the website to mobile
users, left frame is the first example)
3) New context processor: LeftFrameProcessor
4) New b64decode_utf8_or_none utility that decodes a base 64
string into a python str object. (Used to decode cookie values)
5) New get_category_parameters utility that gets parameters for
given category slug. (Used in LeftFrameProcessor and TopicList view)
6) New DEFAULT_CATEGORY setting that identifies the category to be
loaded when the user first requests the website
7) New base64 related decoder/encoder functions in djdict.js (used
to encode/decode cookies)
8) Left frame scrollbar is now tracked.

-- Changes --
1) Left frame data now loads before the view is processed, this
way left frame data loads faster and in a more elegant way.
LeftFrameProcessor is used to fetch the data via TopicListManager.
This context processor goes hand in hand with javascript, communicating
via cookies. So left frame data is no longer maintained in localStorage.
2) "Hayvan-ara" is now cached.
3) "Gündem" does not raise ZeroDivisionError, but it has a dummy text instead.
(Hopefully I'll implement it Soon™)
4) Move left-frame to the new template file as it gets too clustered in base.html
5) Fix a bug in TopicListManager that caused extra cache key generetion
when the year parameter used with the non-tarihte bugün slugs.
6) views.list.TopicList's year property is now cached_property as
it is acessed multiple times.
7) views.list.TopicList now uses get_category_parameters instead
of generating them in view itself
8) Changed some template fragments to be capable of handling new context
processor (particularly for determining active category)
9) Reporting template had a missing link, added that.

--Deletions--
1) Remove the function needed to get csrftoken from cookies, use
js-cookies library to fetch csrftoken instead.
2) Remove the javascript code that loaded left frame date on page
load, (used LeftFrameProcessor instead).

slug safenames to prevent html injection
3) Change tag prompt descriptions.
4) Dropdown search now uses populateSearchResults
5) Revamp 'formatted' filter to look neater. Added tag
descriptions. And changed existing tag regexs to be more
accurate.

--Additions--
New session backend
New session model

-- Changes --
1) Instead of django's default session backend use newly written
session model to pair users with sessinos. In future there will
be account deletion feature, which will make use of this backend.

This change is **incompatible** as you need to migrate data from
django_sessions to dictionary_pairedsessions (if you really care about
currently stored session data, otherwise nothing needs to be done except
new session model migration).
