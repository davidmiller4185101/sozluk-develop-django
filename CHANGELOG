--Additions--
New session backend
New session model

-- Changes --
1) Instead of django's default session backend use newly written
session model to pair users with sessinos. In future there will
be account deletion feature, which will make use of this backend.

This change is **incompatible** as you need to migrate data from
django_sessions to dictionary_pairedsessions (if you really care about
currently stored session data, otherwise nothing needs to be done except
new session model migration).
